Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Md Imrul Kaisar Pinak. I graduated with a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Lethbridge (UofL)](https://www.uleth.ca/), Alberta, Canada. I also worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at UofL. My research interests include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science, and Recommender Systems. My work was nominated for [<span style="color:Red"> **Best Paper Award**</span>](http://coling2018.org/coling-2018-best-papers/) and selected as <span style="color:Red"> **Area Chair Favorite Paper** </span> at [COLING 2018](http://coling2018.org).
